# what did I learn from building a Rest api ?

- I wanted to understand how the Rest API works under the hood And during building this simple API I've learned many things like how to use the `dotenv` PHP library and   how to work with postman and the main thing is how the Rest API work .
- Here are some links that helped me understand the topic:
- [Dotenv Library](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)
- [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Article on how to build Rest API with PHP](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/03/08/simple-rest-api-php#create-the-php-project-skeleton-for-your-rest-api)
